Still, there is no legislation that would call for companies to observe universal requirements. Yet it would improve the company’s general performance in several aspects. It would help:\n\t1)\tRaise foreign investments.\n\t2)\tWin a grant for the further fruitful development.\n\t3)\tAnticipate and control possible risks, objectively assess the company’s turnover.\nWho is an individual entrepreneur?\nIndividual entrepreneur is otherwise called a private person, business owner. This type of activity is really popular nowadays because of its convenience due to two main factors: it does not require any initial capital or preparation of founding documentation.\nPreparation of documentation package takes less time than for the legal person. There are no territorial boundaries, though it is better to obtain all the documents at the place of registration of residence (so that the changes in the Taxpayer Register were made quicker)."

        "text": "If you plan on starting your own company in the big business, staying as an individual entrepreneur or LLC will somehow limit your abilities. In this case, you should establish a joint-stock company. It is the form of engagement in which the authorized capital is divided into shares that have equal asset value. Still, the liability of such association for their obligations are limited to its property, and for shareholders, the risk of losses related to such association’s activity is confined to the cost of their shares, except for cases defined by law.\nThe advantages of conducting business as a joint-stock company include the ability to raise unlimited funds by making contributions into share capital. Moreover, such contributions might be made both by the founders and by third parties. \nOther advantages of joint-stock companies include:\n\t•\tAbility to attract investments;\n\t•\tAbility to receive dividends; \n\t•\tShare ownership gives the right to claim part of joint-stock company’s property in case of its liquidation;\n\t•\tOpportunity for holders of ordinary shares to participate in the company’s management;\n\t•\tBesides other assets shares may be used in any activity of their owner including providing them as collateral;\n\t•\tShareholders are not responsible for joint-stock company’s liabilities but only for its activity to the value of shares they own; \n\t•\tThe responsibility of a joint-stock company for its liabilities is limited to its property; \n\t•\tIn case of success, the market value of the company’s shares might exceed its nominal value significantly.\nThe share capital of a joint-stock company must be at least 1250 minimum wages while the minimum wage level shall be valid at the moment of company’s establishment (registration).\nThere are two types of joint-stock companies: public and private. \nA joint-stock company as any other legal person is considered as established at the moment of State registration in accordance with the law. \nIn order to establish a joint-stock company, its founders have to hold a private placement of shares and constituent assembly and proceed with the State registration.\nStages of the registration of a joint-stock company:\n\t1)\tFounders decide to establish a joint-stock company and hold a private placement of shares;\n\t2)\tApplying to the State Commission for Securities and Stock Market (CSSSM) with the registration of share issuing.\n\t3)\tRegistration of share issuing at SCSSM and providing an appropriate temporary certificate.\n\t4)\tAssigning an international identification number of securities to the shares;\n\t5)\tThe signing of an agreement on servicing the issue of shares with a state institution defined by law, which carries out depositary activities;\n\t6)\tClosed (private) placement of shares among the founders of the company;\n\t7)\tPayment of the full value of shares by the founders;\n\t8)\tThe company’s constituent assembly approves the results of actions taken at stage 6, as well as the company’s constituent documents (charter);\n\t9)\tState registration of the company;\n\t10)\tThe SCSSM registers the report on the results of a closed (private) placement of shares;\n\t11)\tPresentation of the Certificate of registration of a share issue;\n\t12)\tFounders of the company obtain title documents for shares."

        "title": "Registration of Individual entrepreneur",
        "text": "Are you willing to start your own business and get income without establishing a legal person?  If this activity is systematic in nature, you should think of its correct legal arrangement. Registration of Individual entrepreneur is one of the simplest organizational coeval forms of conducting business in Ukraine. We can provide you with lawyer assistance on this matter. \nRegistration of Individual entrepreneur has several important advantages over the legal entity establishment including:\n\t•\tMore simple registration procedure; \n\t•\tAn individual entrepreneur does not have to open a bank account; \n\t•\tOpportunity to conduct simplified accounting (for example, simply keep a record of income and expenses or record exclusively of income, considering the system of taxation chosen by the individual entrepreneur);\n\t•\tOpportunity to apply simplified taxation;\n\t•\tA simple procedure of business liquidation;\n\t•\tNo need to prepare a large number of reports, such as the annual balance sheet, the report on financial results, statistical reports and simplified tax reporting; \n\t•\tThe ability to conduct accounting independently without the services of an accountant.\nYou only need a Ukrainian citizen passport and a taxpayer identification code to register as an individual entrepreneur.\nIn addition, you have to decide on the types of economic activity. The classification of economic activity is established by the current legislation of Ukraine. You also need to choose a taxation system according to which you will pay taxes. Current legislation provides two tax systems for individual entrepreneurs: simplified and generalized.\nIf you choose a generalized system, types of economic activities will not play an important role for you. It is enough to indicate some of them and you still may be engaged in other activities that were not specified during the registration. However, if you plan to pay taxes under the simplified taxation system, it is necessary to specify the types of economic activities that are most relevant to your business, since the simplified taxation system operates exclusively on the chosen types of activities. Though it should be noted that you may always make changes and add some types of economic activities to the list."

        "text": "The current legislation of Ukraine provides for certain procedures for certain individuals in order to ensure effective and transparent procurement, creation of a competitive environment, prevent corruption and develop competition. If you are a legislation actor in the field of public procurement, then you will not be able to avoid the use of procurement procedures, which are provided for by current regulations.\nAccording to the current legislation, tender (bidding) is the competitive selection of participants in accordance with the procedures established by law.\nThe main procurement procedure is open bidding. The application of this procedure involves the development of tender documentation • the main document that defines the conditions for the conduct of public procurement. Such documentation must be developed and approved by any contractor. The correctness of the tender documentation is the key to the procurement of goods/ works/services of the required quality and characteristics, and also helps to avoid and prevent unscrupulous participants and ephemeral firms from participating in the bidding. The security of your rights and interests in case of an appeal against the procurement procedure that you have conducted also depends on how well the tender documentation has been compiled.\nThe tender documentation must necessarily contain the following: \n\t•\tqualification criteria for bidders, \n\t•\tinformation on the technical, qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the subject of the procurement, \n\t•\tplace of delivery of goods (performance of works or provision of services), \n\t•\tdates for the delivery of goods (performance of works or provision of services),\n\t•\tlist of criteria and methodology for the assessment of tender bids, \n\t•\tdeadline for submission of tender bids, \n\t•\tthe validity period of tender bids\n\t•\tdraft of the procurement contract.\nOur experts will assist you in the development of tender documentation and prepare it according to the law."

        "title": "Drafting of contracts",
        "text": "According to law, a contract is a deal between two or more persons that establishes, amends or terminates civil rights and obligations. This is the main form of deals that is used in civil and commercial law. As a consequence, depending on the conditions of a particular contract, it might be regulated by civil or commercial law.  The conclusion of the contract is preceded by its development. The development of any contract should be paid as much attention as possible because it is a document that defines the rights, duties, and responsibilities of the parties. Obtaining the desired result from a particular deal depends on how competently the contract will be drawn up.\nThe contract must include all important conditions determined by the current legislation for a certain type of contract. Otherwise, a contract, in which no essential conditions have been defined, may be considered invalid or not concluded at all. The contract should contain paragraphs specifying the subject of the contract, its duration, price, rights and obligations of the parties and their responsibilities. It is also necessary to clearly define how the contract might be regulated by law since each legislation has its own special features. You should also be aware that according to the current legislation, some contracts should be concluded exclusively in accordance with the model contracts, the conditions of which must not be departed from.\nThus, in order to assist you in this complex process, we provide you with the development of contracts, verification of existing contracts, advising on the protection of your interests during the conclusion of contracts, amending the contract and other services related to the development and conclusion of contracts.\nTherefore, in order for you not to study all the regulations that are constantly changing, our specialists will develop a contract for you keeping in mind all of your requirements and wishes, as well as the essential conditions that are defined by law.\nIf you have a certain contract form (the standard form that you use and/or the option your contractor insists on, etc.) and your goal is to find out the strengths/weaknesses in terms of your interests and adapt the contract to your requirements, we will conduct a legal analysis of the contract provided, give you recommendations for improving or amend the contract.\nIt is also necessary to remember that the contract must correspond with the current law."

        "title": "Preparation and filing of a complaint",
        "text": "Do you need to go to the court and want to be confident in the case success? When going to the court it is important to have a legally well-formed statement of complaint. This aspect is essential because this complaint argues your position, points out the essence of the violation of your rights and interests, which in turn determines the success of the defense of your rights in the court. The court assesses the situation and makes a decision on the basis of this claim. Drawing up a statement of claim is not an easy task since it requires special knowledge and experience, as well as the legal education. If you do not consider all the features and norms of current legislation or go to the wrong court, you will not only lose time because of the procedural bureaucracy related to the refusal to accept the claim but also risk losing the legal opportunity to restore the violated rights. We offer our assistance in carrying out complex work in the preparation and filing of a complaint in the court of any level and jurisdiction. So, here are the main key points in the preparation of the statement of complaint:\n\t1.\tStudy of the case and analysis of its circumstances. Information important for the court is systematized, the preparation of relevant documents is being carried out, circumstances are being ascertained. The development of the claim begins only after a complete study of the circumstances of the case.\n\t2.\tFormation of evidentiary record: collection of documents, preparation of inquiries, examination, written evidence, analysis of accounting documentation and obtaining information from other sources (government agencies, etc.).\n\t3.\tDrawing up a claim: a direct statement of the circumstances of the case, an explanation of the position of the claimant, a clear reference to the norms of the law that have been violated, the presentation and support of the requirements.\n\t4.\tPreparation of attachments to the complaint: a copy of the statement and all documents that are attached to it.\n\t5.\tPayment of the court fee.\n\t6.\tFiling a complaint to the court.\n\t7.\tControl over the status of the statement of claim: our lawyers will make sure that the submitted statement is not returned by the court, and if it is, they will overcome the causes for which such return has happened.\nOf course, each person can prepare a particular document according to a model or template, but each particular case should better be approached individually. Each case refers to a certain legal relation, has specific circumstances and a separate legal process, which is governed by a particular procedural code. Our specialists approach the preparation of each specific complaint individually, taking into account all the necessary components.\nThe statement of claim to the court drawn up by a professional lawyer is a document that strengthens your position, helps to draw the court’s attention to the key circumstances of the case and constitutes the prerequisites for resolving the case in your favor."

Different states have different regulations relating to this type of activity. The place of registration of the legal entity and the country in which the investor is registered is very important for ICO. All participating States have the influence on the legislative part.\nMain countries\nToday there are several countries in the world that might be chosen as the jurisdiction of ICO.\n\t1.\tRussian Federation. Now the government does not have a clear position on the turnover and release of tokens, so the stable business is under threat.\n\t2.\tSwitzerland. Despite the need to obtain permission from FINMA and start a business there, this state offers acceptable conditions.\n\t3.\tSingapore. In general, quite favorable factors, but you need to keep in mind a number of financial risks.\n\t4.\tThe United States offers adequate criteria only for residents.\n\t5.\tEstonia is notable for the transparent process of company registration, which is really convenient for ICO.\nJurisdiction for ICO\nThe correct choice of jurisdiction for ICO gives a number of advantages including the right to obtain a share, access and use the service."

Such taxation is often the main means of income at the state level. Thanks to these rules, international trade is regulated and one’s own interests are respected.\nWhat are customs taxes?\nCustoms taxes may vary in a number of ways. So, according to the direction of the goods, the following types can be considered:\n\t1.\tOn import. This means that goods imported into the country from abroad are subject to taxation. Imported goods are more expensive, which stimulates the development of national production.\n\t2.\tOn export. These taxes are levied on products that are exported. Thanks to these measures, it is possible to maintain the balance of the economy and provide assistance to local enterprises.\n\t3.\tOn transit. They are paid when the goods are transported through the country to a third state.\nThe need for taxes\nThus, customs taxation is a mandatory process in international trade. They are necessary in order to maintain the economic situation in the country and stimulate its own production."

        "title": "Analysis of tender documentation",
        "text": "In order to decide whether to participate in the bidding process, an integrated analysis of the tender documentation and the customer’s draft contract is required.\nThe analysis is carried out in several stages:\n\t1.\tThe legal analysis of the tender documentation and the draft contract for their compliance with the current legislative requirements and for the presence of the corruption component is carried out. In accordance with the current Ukrainian legislation, tender documentation is developed and approved by the customer. It often happens that a customer trying to discourage unwanted participants from bidding includes special, discriminatory or unlawful requirements for the participants to the tender documentation. This way the customer can get rid of any disadvantageous participant saying that he does not meet one of the dubious requirements. It sometimes happens that tender documentation contains requirements that knowingly provide certain benefits exclusively for one participant. For example, a customer combines in one lot services or products that could be in different lots since they themselves are different types of services (goods) - for example, construction and design, or the supply of high-tech equipment and its configuration. Whether it is done on purpose or by accident is not important.\n\t2.\tThe relevance of the goods or services of the enterprise-participant to the requirements of the customer's technical specifications set forth in the tender documentation is determined (particularly, the relevance of the participant to the qualification criteria established by the customer).\n\t3.\tIt is determined whether the company-participant's abilities meet the conditions of the draft contract, which is provided by the tender documentation.\n\t4.\tThe instruction on tender offers submission, provided by the tender documentation, is examined. Quite often customers intentionally write a complicated instruction for submitting tenders for the sake of removing undesirable participants from the bidding. Not knowing the details provided by the tender documentation for submitting tenders, which might seem insignificant, might lead to a rejection of your tender offer for purely formal reasons.\nCompanies participating in bidding often do not pay enough attention to the analysis of tender documentation. This is quite a common mistake, the consequences of which can be very negative, particularly the following:\n\t•\tthe participant's bid might be rejected;\n\t•\tthe participant might win the bidding but lose the opportunity to conclude an agreement also losing all the money paid for supplying of the tender offer (up to 3% of the cost of goods or services).\n"
